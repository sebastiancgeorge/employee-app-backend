#     # ── SETUP ─────────────────────────────────────────────


#     # 1. Build an async engine pointed at an in-memory SQLite database.


#     #    The `+aiosqlite` suffix selects the async driver — without it,


#     #    SQLAlchemy would pick the default sync driver and refuse to mix.


#     engine = create_async_engine("sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:")


#     # 2. Materialise every ORM table on the empty in-memory DB.


#     #    `engine.begin()` is an async context manager that opens a


#     #    transactional connection. `create_all` is a *sync* SQLAlchemy


#     #    call, so we hand it to `conn.run_sync(...)`, which runs it on a


#     #    worker thread (via greenlet) and awaits the result.


#     async with engine.begin() as conn:


#         await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.create_all)


#     # 3. Build the session factory and immediately open one session.


#     #    `expire_on_commit=False` keeps loaded attributes usable after


#     #    `commit()` — the recommended setting for async SQLAlchemy.


#     db = async_sessionmaker(engine, expire_on_commit=False)()


#     # ── ACT ───────────────────────────────────────────────
#     # Build an Employee directly (bypassing the service) so we control
#     # every field — including `password_hash`, which the service drops.
#     seeded = Employee(name="Ada", email="ada@example.com",
#                       password_hash=hash_password("secret123"))
#     # `add()` is sync — it just stages the row in the session's identity map.
#     db.add(seeded)
#     # `commit()` is the IO step — flush + COMMIT to SQLite. Must be awaited.


#     await db.commit()


#     # `refresh()` re-reads the row so `seeded.id` is populated from the DB.


#     await db.refresh(seeded)


#     # Call the function under test — it itself is `async def`, so we await.


#     fetched = await employee_service.get_employee_by_id(seeded.id, db)


#     # ── ASSERT ────────────────────────────────────────────
#     # Same id we seeded — proves the lookup returned the right row.
#     assert fetched.id == seeded.id
#     # Email round-trips through SQLAlchemy unchanged.
#     assert fetched.email == "ada@example.com"

#     # ── TEARDOWN ──────────────────────────────────────────


#     # Close the session — releases the connection back to the pool.


#     await db.close()


#     # Drop every table so the next test starts clean. (We could also let the


#     # engine fall out of scope, but explicit cleanup is the lesson here.)


#     async with engine.begin() as conn:


#         await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.drop_all)


#     # Dispose the engine — closes the underlying connection pool.


#     await engine.dispose()

# `pytest_asyncio` provides the *async-aware* fixture decorator. Plain
# `@pytest.fixture` doesn't know how to drive an `async def` body — you
# have to use `@pytest_asyncio.fixture` whenever the fixture itself is
